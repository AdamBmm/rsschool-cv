      You may ask me why a chemist suddenly decided to become a web developer.
      This is because at school I was engaged in website development and even created a school website with a friend, but fate so happened that I became a chemist and decided to remember something of my youth.
      I studied at the Free Code Camp, received a certificate in HTML and CSS, currently studying JS.</p>
